Supervised machine learning:-

Supervised machine learning is a category of machine learning that uses labeled data to train the algorithm.

It uses input-ootput pairs where the output is known. 

We train the model with these pairs to be able to predict outcomes for the data that isn't labeled. 

It has some steps

Data collection: it includes gathering the dataset that consists of input-output pairs

Model Training: training the machine learning algorithm to be able to learn the relationship between inputs and output labels. 

Validation: We test the model on a subset of the data without output labels. 

Prediction: We give the trained model new unlabeled data to predict outcomes. 

Their are several algorithms used in supervised learning: decision trees, support vector machine, neural networks and k-nearest neighbor. 

Cancer is a complex disease with several types. 

It requires special tools for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. 

The role of supervised machine learning:-

Classify tumor types: by analyzing genetic markers and histopathological images. 

Predict patient outcomes: estimating survival rates and response to treatment. 

Optimize treatment plans: recommending personalized treatment options based on patient characteristic. 

Early detection of cancer increases the chances of successful treatment.

We can use supervised machine learning in image classification for early diagnosis.

We can Classify images produced by mammograms, CT scans and MRIs to decide whether the patient has tumor or not.

Machine learning models can be trained on large datasets of labeled medical images to recognize patterns in malignant tumors. 

Breast cancer: convolutional neural networks designed for image recognition can be trained on thousands of labeled images and can accurately Classify breast tissue whether normal or cancerous. 

Genomic Data Analysis for personalized treatment:-

Cancer is largely driven by genetic mutations.

Supervised learning Algorithms can process large datasets of genomic sequences and correlate specific mutations. For example, the identification of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations in breast and ovarian cancer patients is more efficient using machine learning.

Predicting treatment plans :-

Models can be used in predicting which patients are most likely to benefit from a specific treatment based on their medical history, genetic markers, and other data.

Drug development:-

Machine learning models can be trained on datasets that includes information on known drug compounds, their molecular structures, and their effect on cancer cells.

Machine learning models have been employed in the discovery of novel kinase inhibitors, which are class of drugs that block enzymes involved in cancer cell proliferation.

Survival Rate Prediction:-

Models can process age, tumor size, genetic profile, and treatment history to predict patient survival with high accuracy.
